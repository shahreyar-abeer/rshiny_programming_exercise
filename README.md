# rshiny_programming_exercise  

A Shiny programming exercise for developer evaluation.  

### Intructions to run the app:

1. Download or clone the repo.  
2. Open the `rshiny_programming_exercise.Rproj` file. (It should automatically open in RStudio).  
3. Open any one of `ui.R` or `server.R` or `global.R` from the app/ directory.  
4. Press **Run App** on the top-right corner of the script.  

Or, after step 2, you can do the following:

3. Type `setwd("./app")` in the console.  
4. And then type `shiny::runApp()`.  

The first time of running, the program will *automatically install* the required packages.  
Just make sure you have a couple of minutes to spare!  

Oh and if you have an RStudio Cloud id, you can find an online version of the project [here.](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1163822)  

### Some final notes  

It was mentioned in the instuctions.txt file that the expected time to complete this task was 4-5 hours.  
I have worked on the project for a bit longer than the expected time.  
Now the reason behind this is a bit abstract.  

> To me, developing shiny is an art.  
> Tell me this, how much time would you give a poet to write a 4 liner poem?  
> I say coding is just peoms with Mathematics. You write something and you delete it, over and over, until you are happy with it; isn't that how poems are written? And I won't mention craftsmanship (which I don't have) is required.
